# Apple II-related templates for HexFiend (OS X)

[HexFiend](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/HexFiend) is a "fast and clever open source hex editor for macOS." As of version 2.9, it includes support for [Binary Templates](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/HexFiend/blob/master/templates/Tutorial.md), which can display structured data as more than just a bunch hexes.

Drop these in your Templates folder (`~/Library/Application Support/com.ridiculousfish.HexFiend/Templates/`, but there's an Open Templates menu so you don't have to remember that.)
